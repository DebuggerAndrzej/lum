Very simple and basic text editor written in go using ascii escape sequences to manipulate terminal output.

# Installation
```
 go install github.com/DebuggerAndrzej/lum@latest
```
Requirements:
- go 1.23 or newer

> [!TIP]
> default installation path for go is ~/go/bin so in order to have lum command available this path has to be added to shell user paths.
